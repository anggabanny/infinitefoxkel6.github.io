        <ul>
            <li>Cappucino</li>
            <p>Cappuccino is a coffee-based drink made primarily from espresso and milk. It consists of one-third espresso, one-third heated milk and one-third milk foam and is generally served in a 6 to 8-ounce cup. The cappuccino is considered one of the original espresso drinks representative of Italian espresso cuisine and eventually Italian-American espresso cuisine</p>
            <li>Caffè Latte</li>
            <p>Caffè latte is a coffee-based drink made primarily from espresso and steamed milk. It consists of one-third espresso, two-thirds heated milk and about 1cm of foam. Depending on the skill of the barista, the foam can be poured in such a way to create a picture. Common pictures that appear in lattes are love hearts and ferns. Latte art is an interesting topic in itself.</p>
            <li>Caffè Machiato</li>
            <p>Caffè macchiato is an espresso-based coffee beverage consisting mostly of coffee with a small amount of milk. Translating from the Italian phrase meaning marked coffee, this drink is made by "marking" a single shot of espresso with a few drops of frothed milk and served in a demitasse. Relative to other espresso-based drinks, a caffè macchiato is closer to a straight espresso, containing substantially less milk than a cappuccino . It can be used as an alternative to adding sugar to espresso, muting the bite of the espresso without adding sweetness</p>
            <li>Espresso</li>
            <p>Espresso is the name of a highly concentrated, bittersweet coffee originating in Italy in the early 20th century. Translated from Italian, the word espresso refers to the speed and single-serve nature of the coffee compared with slower and more communal methods of brewing coffee</p>
            <li>Long Black</li>
            <p>Long Black is a beverage made by pouring a double-shot of espresso over hot water. It is commonly served in Australia and New Zealand.[1] The Long Black is different than an americano, as the former has more crema than the latter. The Long Black also has a stronger flavor.</p>
            <li>Americano</li>
            <p>Americano is an espresso-based drink designed to resemble coffee brewed in a drip filter, considered popular in the United States of America. This drink consists of a single or double-shot of espresso combined with up to four or five ounces of hot water in a two-demitasse cup.</p>
