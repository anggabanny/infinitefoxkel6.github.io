            <li>Flavoured Latte</li>
            <p>Flavored lattes are, quite simply, a Caffé Latte with flavoring syrup or powder added. The steamed milk and espresso drink is the perfect foundation for extra flavor. The milk acts as a blank canvas that is just waiting for your taste buds to decide what to paint on it.</p>
            <li>Frappe</li>
            <p>Frappe is an iced beverage that has been shaken, blended or beaten to produce a tasty, foamy, and refreshing drink. It is served cold, often with whipped cream and toppings. You can add ice before or after beating the coffee and custom additives such as sugar, milk, vanilla, and sweet sauces.</p>
            <li>Chocolate</li>
            <p>Chocolate also known as drinking chocolate, cocoa, and as chocolate tea in Nigeria, is a heated drink consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream or marshmallows. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.</p>
